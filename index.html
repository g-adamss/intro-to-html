<h1>About Me!</h1>

<p>Hello! My name is Georgia Adams, and I am a first year student in the Graphic Design Program at Algonquin College! I am 19 going on 20 this year, and for a 10 of those 19 years I have been practicing with different mediums of art. I started to take art seriously when I was living in the United States for 3 years, and I took multiple art classes all throughout high school. I took a ga year after leaving university and soon after I applied to the Graphic Design Program with high hopes, and here I am! 
</p>

<p>My biggest supporters of my choice in pursing art would have to be my family and close friends. I originally applied to university for sociology, as I just wanted to get a degree, and I wasn’t actually pursuing something I enjoyed. However after taking a step back and realizing that art isn’t a useless career (as some people told me growing up) I decided to apply, and I am so glad that I did. Life is too short to be “spending” (wasting) time doing something that you don’t enjoy.</p>
